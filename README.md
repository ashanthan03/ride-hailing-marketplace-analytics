# 🚀 Ride-Hailing Marketplace Analytics & Optimization Simulator

## 🔗 Live Demo
👉 https://ride-hailing-marketplace-analytics.streamlit.app/

---

A data-driven simulation of a ride-hailing marketplace (Rapido/Uber-style system) that models demand-supply imbalance, surge pricing, rider allocation, and revenue optimization.

This project analyzes how rider supply impacts:
- Revenue
- Fulfillment rate
- Rider utilization
- Surge pricing intensity
- Demand-supply imbalance

It also includes an optional Reinforcement Learning-based allocation engine.

## 📌 Business Problem

Ride-hailing platforms face constant imbalance between:

- Rider Supply
- Customer Demand

If supply is low:
- Surge increases
- Revenue per ride increases
- Fulfillment rate drops
- Rider utilization spikes

If supply is high:
- Fulfillment improves
- Surge drops
- Revenue stabilizes
- Rider utilization decreases

This simulator models these trade-offs quantitatively.

## 🧮 Core Insight Demonstrated

Example Scenario:

| Riders | Requests | Fulfillment | Utilization | Revenue |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|----------|
| 205    | 6000     | ~41%        | ~98%        | ~₹98K    |
| 2000   | 6000     | 100%        | ~24%        | ~₹148K   |

Insights:
- Increasing supply improves fulfillment
- Utilization decreases with excess supply
- Revenue plateaus beyond optimal rider count
- Surge intensity reduces with high supply
